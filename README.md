# Vision-KAN
As we all know, KAN has a very slow training speed and weak task performance. We aim to optimize the training speed of KAN and improve the performance on 2D Image tasks.

Due to the surge in popularity of KAN, we plan to incorporate KAN into ViT models for evaluation. We will integrate KAN into familiar Vision model architectures such as MAE, CLIP, and ViTs to enhance interpretability and performance. Stay tuned to see what challenges we encounter and how we effectively improve them!
